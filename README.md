Wheel
=====

An interactive booth based on the wheel of fortune game

Firefox
-------

Wheel is best used with the Firefox browser (OK, uzbl is better, but not nicely starting in fullscreen mode).

To automate FF, you need the Remote Control extension (https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/remote-control/).

  * Install the extension
  * Configure the extension to start on the active tab
  * Add Remote Control to the toolbar (customize toolbar, ...)
  * Start FF with the command: `firefox -remote-control`

Now you can control FF via telnet on port 32000 (default)
